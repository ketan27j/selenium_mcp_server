# Setup Instruction

To create a virtual environment using Python venv, run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

This will create a directory named `env` in your current directory, which contains the virtual environment. To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

- On Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, you can install packages within this environment without affecting your global Python installation.
